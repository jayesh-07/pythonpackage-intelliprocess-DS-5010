# intelliprocess: for machine learning data preprocessing

## What is intelliprocess?

**intelliprocess** is a comprehensive Python package aimed at providing limited data 
pre-processing capabilities to industry professionals, researchers, and 
academics of numerous backgrounds. The package can take in CSV files containing 
both numeric and categorical variable types and permits tidying, normalization/vector 
scaling and selection of data, with output selections available in various file types. 
In addition, this package supports data visualization with the use of external Python 
libraries to implement statistical plots for data evaluation and curation, alongside 
other machine learning techniques.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that intelliprocess does well:

  - Imputing Missing Values
    - Numerical imputation using the mean.
    - Categorical imputation using the mode.

  - Encode Categorical data
    - Provide suggestions and recommends either One-hot encoding, Binary encoding, Label encoding based on the data.

  - Normalization of Data
    - Skewness number check using Pearson - Fisher method.
    - Calculate to detect outliers and return a dataframe as a csv file with outliers removed.

  - Scaling Numerical Data
    - Logarithmic transofrmation of individual variables with output plots comparing original to transformed data. 
    - Box-Cox transofrmation of individual variables with output plots comparing original to transformed data. 

  - Data Visualization
    - Histograms w/ different bin sizes (5,10,15,20)
    - Boxplots
    - Correlation matrix heatmap
    - Scatter plots
