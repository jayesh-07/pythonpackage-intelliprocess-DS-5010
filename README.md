# intelliprocess: for machine learning data preprocessing

## What is it?

**intelliprocess** is a comprehensive Python package aimed at providing limited data 
pre-processing capabilities to industry professionals, researchers, and 
academics of numerous backgrounds. The package can take in CSV files containing 
both numeric and categorical variable types and permits tidying, normalization/vector 
scaling and selection of data, with output selections available in various file types. 
In addition, this package supports data visualization with the use of external Python 
libraries to implement statistical plots for data evaluation and curation, alongside 
other machine learning techniques.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that intelliprocess does well:

  - Reccomendations to insturct users on Handling missing values in dataset
    - numerical (mean)
    - NaN
  - Encode Categorical data
    - One-hot encoding, Binary encoding, Label encoding
  - Scaling Numerical Data
  - Check for skew; apply appropriate transformation (box-cox, log transform, or rank-based methods
    - If normal perform standardization
    - Calculate outliers and return df with outliers removed 
  - Data Visualization
    - Boxplots
    - Correlation matrix heatmap
    - ScatterPlots
